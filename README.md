# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

Installation
To install Redux and related packages, follow these steps:

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

Run the following command to initialize your project with Vite:


npm init vite@latest
Follow the prompts to set up your project. Choose "react" as the template when prompted.

After initializing the project, navigate into the project directory:

cd your-project-name
Install Redux and related packages:


npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit
This command installs Redux, React bindings for Redux, and Redux Toolkit, which provides utilities for simplifying Redux development.
# redux
Setup
Once you have Redux installed, follow these steps to set it up in your project:

Create a Redux Store: Create a Redux store to hold the application state.

In your project directory, create a store directory.
Inside the store directory, create a reducers directory to store your reducers.
Define your reducers to manage different parts of the state.
Create Redux Actions: Define action creators to create actions that describe state changes.

Create an actions directory within your store directory.
Define action types as constants to maintain consistency.
Create action creators to generate actions.
Combine Reducers: Use the combineReducers function from Redux to combine multiple reducers into a single reducer function.

In your reducers directory, create an index.js file.
Use combineReducers to combine all reducers.
Configure Redux Store: Configure the Redux store using the configureStore function from Redux Toolkit.

Create a store.js file in your store directory.
Use configureStore to create the Redux store, passing in the combined reducer and any middleware.
Integrate with React: Integrate Redux with your React application.

In your root component (e.g., App.jsx), wrap your component hierarchy with the Provider component from react-redux.
Pass the Redux store as a prop to the Provider component.
Usage
Once Redux is set up in your project, you can start using it to manage application state.

Dispatch Actions: Dispatch actions from your components to trigger state changes.

Update State with Reducers: Define reducer functions to update the state based on dispatched actions.

Access State: Use the useSelector hook from react-redux to access state values in your components.

Modify State: Use the useDispatch hook from react-redux to dispatch actions to modify state.
